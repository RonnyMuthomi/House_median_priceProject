# House Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the median house price in a given division using a machine learning model. Currently, the process is done manually, which is costly, time-consuming, and prone to errors. By leveraging machine learning, we aim to provide a more accurate and efficient solution.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Problem Statement
The existing manual method of determining house prices leads to inaccurate valuations and inefficiencies. This project automates the process using a regression model to provide better price estimations.

## Approach
- **Data Collection**: Gather and preprocess housing data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze patterns and relationships within the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering**: Select and transform relevant features for better model performance.
- **Model Selection**: Implement a regression model using `LinearRegression` from scikit-learn.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Train the model and assess its accuracy using appropriate metrics.

## Installation
To set up the project environment, install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset.
2. Preprocess the data (handle missing values, normalize features, etc.).
3. Train the `LinearRegression` model.
4. Make predictions on new data.
5. Evaluate the model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.

## Expected Outcomes
- Faster and more accurate house price predictions.
- Reduction in manual errors.
- A deployable model that can assist in real estate pricing decisions.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with other regression models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Incorporate additional features like location data, economic factors, etc.
- Deploy the model as a web application for real-time predictions.
